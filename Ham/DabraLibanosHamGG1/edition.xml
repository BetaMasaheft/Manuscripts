              <note>The edition by Carlo Conti Rossini on p.202 contains በ፭፪ወ፭ instead of በ፭፻ወ፭,
                which seems to be a simple type-error, for non of the witnesses contain this date
                and it is not marked in the apparatus. It is proved by the date, 1321, which Carlo
                Conti Rossini must have counted from በ፭፻ወ፭. Further, it reads ውስተ፡ ሀገሩ፡ ዘመጣዕ, while
                it is ውስተ፡ ሀገሩ in the manuscript, ወአልህምትሂ፡ ፲፪ instead of ወአልህምትሂ፡ ፲፻,ሰራዌልየ instead

              <note>Roger Schneider, as I can judge from his transcription, read ከመ፡ ይወኀሰኒ what I
                read as ከመ፡ ይወኀሰኒ, this must be a simple error. Roger Schneider read ዕራቅየ what I
                read as ዕሬቅየ and what Carlo Conti Rossini on p. 20 read as ዕረቅየ. Roger Schneider
                reads ኢዘተሰይም what I read as ኢዘተሰይመ, what also seems to be a simple error by
                transcribing. To ኢዘነገሠ Roger Schneider gives a comment that 'Sic ms. Read probably
                ነግሠ፡ Conti Rossini, p. 204, line 1, gives ተነግሠ, but this form is not otherwise
                attested'. In the photo by Alessandro Bausi the reading is as I present here. What I
                read as ወ፳፡ ልብሰ, Roger Schneider read as ወአ፡ ልባሰ, while Carlo Conti Rossini read as
                ወአልባስ. This reading is not clear, but there are definetly two dotts after two first
                characters. በ፭፻፡ ወ፯ Carlo Conti Rossini reads on p. 203 as በ፭፻፡ ወ፮, ብሌን፡ ሰባ as ብሌን፡
                ሳባ, noting ብሌን፡ ሰባ as a variant reading in "A". ዘኢይበኦ ܸConti Rossini emended on the
                basis of "B" reading as ዘኢይበውኦ two times. ቃል፡ ነጋሲ Conti Rossini reads as ቃለ፡ ነጋሲ,
                which is also in "B", but it is not marked in the apparatus. ስይምተ፡ እንትርታ Conti
                Rossini reads as ሠየምተ፡ እንትርታ, which can not be interpreted otherwise as an error.
                ወበዘ፡ ይመጽእ Conti Rossini read as ወበዝ፡ ይመጽእ. እግዚእየ፡ ንጉሥ Conti Rossini erroneously read
                እግዚእነ፡ ንጉሥ. Conti Rossini emended ሖሪ as ሑሪ. At the end Roger Schneider notes in
                brackets that 'a line of dots and strokes as a separation.'</note>

                and while sǝyum of Zaredā Zarʾa Dāwit, and while ʿaqābe saʿata Maṭāʿ Gabra Krəstos.
                I gave this, knowing that the whole world will pass, and I have heard the word of
                Ecclesiastes saying, 'Vanity, all is vanity, unless one prepares his provisions
                beforehead alive'. And I gave to Maṭā‘ and to the holy ones 150 cows and linen
                vestments and I loaded offerings that I brought from ʾAmḥarā. If there will be
                anyone who usurps this gwəlt which I gave for offering and for commemoration of my
                beloved Maṭāʿ, may he be excommunicated by the mouth of the 15 prophets and by the
                mouth of 12 Apostles, by the mouth of 318 righteous of faith, by the mouth of Ṗeṭros
                liqa ṗāṗāsāt, by the prayer of the blessed Maṭāʿ and by the mouth of the Father. And
                the Son and the Holy Spirit may he be excommunicated in this world<pb n="9v"/>and in
                the world that comes. This [transgression] can not be released through fasting or
                prayer, begging or bows for ages of ages, Amen. I offered this gwəlt and did all
                this as <persName ref="PRS1854Amdase"><roleName type="title">my lord King
                  </roleName>ʿĀmda Ṣǝyon </persName> ordered me, saying, 'Go, come to Maṭāʿof ʾAham
                and do the will of the blessed Maṭāʿ, my beloved. And say: "Do not abandon, o Lord,

              <note>Roger Schneider's translator, as he used the edited text by Conti Rossini,
                translated በ፭፻፡ ወ፯፡ ዓመተ፡ ምሕረት, what I translate as 'In the 507th year of Mercy' as
                'In the Year of Mercy 506.' in ስዩመ፡ ዘሬዳ the translator interprets ዘ as an element to
                express a genitive case relationship: thus, what I translate as 'sǝyum of Zaredā
                Zarʾa Dāwit' he translates as 'the governor of Redā'. ኢትንሥኦ፡ እግዚኦ፡ በመዋዕለ፡ ውርዙቱ፡
                ለእግዚእየ፡ ዐምደ፡ ጽዮን, which I translate as 'Do not abandon, o Lord, my Lord ʿĀmda Ṣǝyon
                in the days of his youth' he translates as 'Do not abandor my lord ʿĀmda Ṣǝyon in
                the days of his youth'. There are other cases, which should be rather discussed for
                my choice is dubious: ከመ፡ ይትወኀሰኒ, which I tranlate as 'would beseech a reward for
                me', he translates as 'may be my guarantor'; ዘኢይበኦ, which I translate as 'should not
                penestrate' he translates more literally (may be correctly)'shall enter'; ኢዘነገሠ፡
                ወኢዘአንገስገሰ, which I translate as 'neither the one who reigns nor who is agitated' he
                translates as 'neither the one who is made king nor the one who made king'; <sic>ቃል፡
                </sic>ነጋሲ፡ ወኢደቀ፡ ጽርኅ, which I translate as 'neither the spokesman of nǝguś, nor
                children of the palace' he translates as 'neither the proxy of the king nor the
                pages (I am not sure about my interpretation for it makes little sense for me) of
                the palace'; ወለእመቦ፡ ዘተአገለ, which I traslate as 'if there is anyone who frauds' he
                translates as 'if there be anyone who transgresses'; ወመባእሂ፡ ጽዒንየ፡ ዘአውረድኩ፡ በአምኀራ,
                which I translates as ' I loaded offerings that I brought from ʾAmḥarā' he
                translates as 'and offerings which I brought down through Amhara on pack animals
                (marked with a question-mark by a translator himself)'; ዘኢይትፈታሕ, which I translate
                as 'This [transgression] can not be released' he translates as 'in such a way that
                it cannot be revoked'; </note>

                <note>Roger Schneider has two notes to this document, he comments two cases (also
                noted by Conti Rossini as 'illeggibile') which I noted as 'effaced': 1.One line
                erased. 2. One of the lines erased. The first letter seems to be ለ, the third
                perhaps ፈ. </note>

            <note>Roger Schneider noted: 1.(ይኵነኒ፡ ጕልተ):The faint traces of the first letter could be
              read ጕ. 2.(ለእንግዳ): Conti Rossini read as ለእንግዖ፡ But the <emph>sadəs</emph> vowel
              markers of the <emph>alef,</emph>last letter of the line, is faintly, but securely,
              distinguishable. What Conti Rossini has taken as the body of an <emph>ayn</emph> in
              the last letter is the upper part of ዳ; for <emph>ayn</emph> it would be larger, and
              the vowel marker for <emph>o</emph> would have to come out of the left side of the
              body. The letter is ዳ, but the right side of the lower part is very faint. Roger
              Schneider read ወሰማዕት as ወሰማዕታት, without noting any change. ፫፻፲ወ፷ as ፫፻፡ ወ፰, which is a
              mistake. In addition to what Roger Schneider noted, Conti Rossini emended ደብረ፡ ማዕጾ as
              ዘደብረ፡ ማዕጾ, ዘአግበአ as ዘአግብአ፡ </note>

            <note>Roger Schneider noted: 'Several passages in A have been erased. This is regularly
              the case for the name of King ʿĀmda Ṣǝyon, which has been replaced, by a much later
              hand, by Gabra Masqal or left blank; this was already the case when Conti Rossini saw
              the manuscript. In our copy these passages have been replaced, between brackets, by
              the text as given by Conti Rossini, where these passages are based on the copy B. The
              reading of A is given in a foootnote. in A the last lines of the text are missing.'

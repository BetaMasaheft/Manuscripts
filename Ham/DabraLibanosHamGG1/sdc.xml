    The following are permutations of type P1, changes in the order of the folios, which produce a new UniCirc, but not a new UniProd.
    After cross checking convergent discontinuities in the table view, we can  safely say that the folio numbered by Schneider 17/18, the same as Bausi II 15, 
    is the leaf which CCR had before the one with the cross in his description, the ancient leaf. If we follow Conti Rossini description, the two leaves after the small 
    quire are not there. In facts photo 001 by Schneider shows that the sequence sees the end of the small quire and then the folio which has the coptic cross 
    on the verso. Of all folios available the one which carries the texts which Conti Rossini dates the earliest is the one which we now numbered 27, 
    which is delimited by convergent discontinuities, and was referenced as said above
    previously. We can thus say that there was at least one permutation of the order of the leaves, before they were photographed in 1975 and that this one moved to its current position.

           at 24 and 25 (Bausi II 12 and II 13). It may have appeared obvious to someone that in their position at that time they interrupted the continuity of a content Unit (CCR 20).

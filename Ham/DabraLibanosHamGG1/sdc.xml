<!--    The entirety of the added leaves do not constitute a unit of any kind, until they become an object of interest as in this contribution.
    There are two main UniProd based on size and thus material units
    one is the small quire and the other is the unit of the size of the Gospel

            There is no sign that these four bifolia where once separated and thus there is no sign that this was a quire or

            It is only part of it, or rather the two outer bifolia where, in the same act of production, used to surround the inner leaves, which share in 
            layout, ruling and writing.

    transformation
    The two leaves with the end of the Gadla Qirqos, distinguished from the rest because of the ruling pattern and material, were taken from another, 
    unknown mss 
    to produce UniProd1. 
    
    if the texts on p1 f.11v and 12v where already there when the leaves where used to produce uniprod1, we do not know. CCR dates them later than the text of the Gadla 
    Qirqos, which however does not help in this respect. They where added to that material in any case.
    
    a23 was not accounted by CCR, which may hint at a later addition to the quire than the date of his observation.

                     <note>The Ms. is incomplete; numerous fols. are missing:</note>

                     <note>- Gǝnbot: 15th-16th are missing. 30th is incomplete</note>
                     <note>- Säne: 1st-14th; 16th-19th are missing</note>
                     <note>- Ḥamle: 1st, 6th-8th, 11th-16th, 19th-28th are missing</note>

                     <note>- Ṗagwǝmen: entire month is missing.</note>
                     <note>The text is laid out in two columns, possibly a typical feature of Synaxarion ma nuscript before the mid-16th cent. (three columns were introduced later).</note>
                     <note/>
                     <note>Fol. 60, containing part of the entry for 8th Ṭǝrr, is misplaced.</note>
                     <note>In fol. 98 the commemorative date is partly rubbed out (፲ወ?):</note>
                     <note>- mentioned are here: abba Sawiros, abba Yaʿqob; commemorated on 14th Yäkkatit (see: ColSyn X<ref type="mss" corresp="ES542546">542-546</ref>)</note>
                     <note>- however, the commemorative notices for 14th Yäkkatit are written on fol. 97ra-98ra; here, abba Ṭimote (Timothy Patriarch of Alexandria) among others is mentioned who is commemorated on 13th Yäkkatit (see: ColSyn X<ref type="mss" corresp="ES536537">536-537</ref>).</note>
                     <note/>
                     <note>The text differs significantly from the published/edited versions (GUIDI-COLIN, BUDGE, recent Ethiopian church edition) in terms of language, e.g., spelling of names (persons and places, e.g., fol. 11va: Qǝwsṭos instead of Qwäsṭänṭinos [Constantine], fol. 12ra: ʾAtnatyos instead of ʾAtnasyos [Athanasius]) and in terms of content. Some entries are much shorter (e.g., 23th Miyazya – George of Lydda, fols. 14<ref type="mss" corresp="ES1va141">1va-141</ref>ra) and not all saints of the universal church are mentioned (like St. Qirqos, 15th Ṭǝrr). The Ethiopian saints like ʾƎwoṭaṭewos (18th Mäskäräm), Gäbrä Mänfäs Qeddus (30th Mäggabit), Libanos/Mäṭaʿ (3rd Ṭǝrr), Yared (11th Gǝnbot), King Kaleb (20th Gǝnbot) are not commemorated at all.</note>
                     <note>It is possible that the Sǝnkǝssar for the entire year was written in only one codex, even though the division of the text into two codices has been a common practice – at least later. In this Ms. the end of the first half of the year (30th Yäkkatit) and the beginning of the second half (1st Mäggabit) are written on the same folio (fol. 104ra). The whole text is written in the same hand. However, a division of this comprehensive text in a different way could be also possible.</note>

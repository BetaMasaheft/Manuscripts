                                provenance: Mid-18th century. There is no colophon giving the date
                                of composition. However, the hand and style of the paintings are in
                                keeping with a mid eighteenth century date. The invocations for
                                blessings throughout the text are mostly made for one Lätes'un (m.)
                                occasionally in conjunction with that Wälättä Täklä Haymanot (f.).
                                However, the name Awsabyos (m.) has been inserted in the top margin
                                of many leaves, and also appears alongside the picture of the
                                prostrate supplicant in paintings 2, 54 and 55, though in the last
                                instance the figure is clearly female. </p><p> The text comprises 34
                                miracles of the Virgin Mary together with 3 miracles of St. George.

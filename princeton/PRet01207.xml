There is no colophon giving the date of composition. However, the hand and style of the paintings are in keeping with a mid eighteenth century date. The invocations for blessings throughout the text are mostly made for one Lätes'un (m.) occasionally in conjunction with that Wälättä Täklä Haymanot (f.). However, the name Awsabyos (m.) has been inserted in the top margin of many leaves, and also appears alongside the picture of the prostrate supplicant in paintings 2, 54 and 55, though in the last instance the figure is clearly female. </p><p>  The text comprises 34 miracles of the Virgin Mary together with 3 miracles of St. George. </p><p> Fol. 1r: Blank except for pen trial.</p><p> Purchase, Sam Fogg, London.</p><!--BIBLIOGRAPHY--></summary><msItem xml:id="ms_i1"><locus>Located on folio 5r-155r.</locus><title>Miracles of Mary</title><date cert="low" notBefore="1740" notAfter="1760">mid

                                ascetic life.</p>
                     <p>How the Virgin Mary saved the robber's soul from
                                judgment because he drank from water that sprang from her
                                feet.</p>
                     <p>How the Virgin Mary appeared to a certain ascetic woman
                                to reassure her about the purity of her friends, other ascetics in
                                the monastery (similar to twenty-second miracle later in this
                                manuscript).</p>

                                up fasting at her husband's command (incomplete at the end) (Budge,
                                Mary, 99).</p>
                     <p>How the Virgin Mary saved a drunken monk from a
                                lion (Budge, Mary, 48).</p>
                     <p>How the Virgin Mary helped Säwla, wife

                     <p>The original owner's name, Kəflä Mika'e, is
                                mentioned in this text at the beginning of most of the miracles. The
                                later owner has erased the original owner's name in the first few
                                folios. But the name of Säga Mika'el, the father of Kəflä Mika'e,
                                which also appears at the beginning of some miracles has escaped the
                                eraser because his name is in black ink not red. Some other names
                                sometimes appear at the beginning of the miracles, but those
                                mentioned above are the most common.</p>

                        <summary>From Catalogue: 160 ff. 2 cols, to a page (except ff. 3-6 which have 3 cols, to a page).
                            Each col. has 20 lines (with the exception of ff. 3-6 where each col. has
                            an average of 28 lines). Vellum. 13% X 11% in- Abyssinian binding wooden boards covered with stamped leather.
                            The MS was written by three scribes: 1) ff. 3-6 in  small and very fine hand; 2) the main part, ff. 8-156r, in a large, clear, though not exceptionally beautiful, hand; 3) ff. I56b-i59 in a hand similar to that of 2), but written in a quick and slovenly manner.
                            Date: The name of " our king Bakäffä " appears at f. I7b et passim , but is generally written over an erasure. Palaeographical criteria sup port the dating about A.D. 1725; ff. 3-6 might well be a century older.
                            Profusely illustrated. The first two lines of each Miracle are ru-
                            bricated.
                            Owned by the Church of Madhäne Alam at Magdala (f. 8a), but
                            the note to this effect was, of course, added by a later hand, pro-
                            bably at the time of King Theodore.
                            The Miracles of our Lord Jesus . - Cf. Wright (B.M.) LXVII (Orient.
                            620) with which the present MS is very largely identical.
                            f . 2a. Beginning of Book of Miracles of the Virgin Mary, but conti-
                            nuation erased.
                            f. 3». Hymn to Abba Salämä, .
                            Cf. Wright (B.M.) CXCIX, 2. 'Salämä' rubricated; similarly
                            ' Märyäm ' and ' Qërïllos '  Partly damaged by damp.
                            f. 6b. Full page multicoloured picture of the Trinity. Inscribed Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. In the usual vein of Abyssinian picto rial art.
                            f. 7a. Full page picture of the Virgin Mary and the Child,
                            f. 8. Miracles of our Lord Jesus. For incipit cf. the identical pas-
                            sage in Wright (B.M.) p. 43, col. 2.
                            f. I56b-f. 159. Written in a different hand by a careless scribe
                            (see introductory remarks above).
                            Some Miracles of Abuna Takla Häymänot. - ' Takla Häymänot ' rubricated.
                            
                            From website: The Miracles of Jesus (ff. 8-156, written in a large clear hand) consist largely of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, describing the Miracles Jesus performed as a young child. This manuscript also includes the beginning of the Book of Miracles of the Virgin Mary (f.2); a hymn to Abba Salama, the fourteenth century head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (ff. 3–6) and some Miracles of the Ethiopian Saint Abuna Takla Haymanot (ff. 156–9); all later additions written in different hands.
                            
                            References to King Bakaffa (d.1730) supports the early 18th century date of the main text. This section of the manuscript opens with a full page painting of the Trinity labelled ‘Father, Son, and Holy Ghost’ (f. 6v) opposite a full page picture of the Virgin Mary and Child (f. 7r). Below the figures are portraits of the manuscript’s patrons, a husband and wife, prostrated at their feet.  61 other paintings illustrate the text including a full page image of the crucifixion (f.121v).
                            The bindings comprise wooden boards covered with stamped leather tooled with large crosses at the centre and the inner cover has a textile inlay. The manuscript was rebound and re-backed by the India Office in the late 19th century.

                        <summary>An Ethiopian manuscript of the Four Gospels written in Geez, the ancient liturgical language of the Ethiopian church.
                            
                            The Ethiopian Bible is thought to have been translated into Geez largely from the Greek and Syriac texts of the Syrian church from the 4th to the 7th centuries, likely by Syrian monks who founded monasteries in Ethiopia.
                            
                            The Four Gospels text (ff. 16-187) is written in 2 columns, 21 lines to a page. The volume begins with texts in a smaller hand in three columns (ff. 2-15) comprising an introduction (ff. 2v-6v), Epistle of Eusebius to Carpianus (ff. 7r-8r), the Eusebian Canons (ff. 8v-9r) and the ‘Tabulae harmonicae seu canones harmoniae Evangeliorum’ (ff. 9v-15v).
                            
                            The bindings comprises wooden boards covered with stamped leather tooled with large crosses at the centre and the inner cover has a textile inlay. The manuscript was rebound and re-backed by the India Office in the late 19th century.
                            
                            This manuscript was among a group of an estimated 1000 manuscripts acquired from churches across Ethiopia by Emperor Tewodros II (d. 1868) intended for the church and library he planned to build at Maqdala, his fortress in Northern Ethiopia. The original owner was Gabra Egziabher Takla Haymanot (see f. 17r).
                            
                            In April 1868 British forces led by Lieutenant General Sir Robert Napier laid siege to the fortress to secure the release of British hostages held there (see RCIN 2500869) and Tewodros took his own life. Tewodros’s manuscripts, then stored in huts near his temporary church at Maqdala, were among the items subsequently auctioned as spoils of war. Many of these (approximately 400) were bought by Richard Holmes (see RCINs 917350-2 and 922419) who had been sent by the British Museum as part of the Abyssinian Expedition specifically to acquire antiquities and manuscripts in Ethiopia. Richard Holmes presented sixteen of the manuscripts to Queen Victoria who retained six for the Royal Library (RCINs 1005079-1005084) and in 1869 offered ten back to the Trustees of the British Museum. In 1973 those manuscripts were transferred to the British Library.

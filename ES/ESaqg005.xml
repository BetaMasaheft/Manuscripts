                     <note>- Some folios are missing and many are misplaced.</note>
                     <note>For the reconstruction of the texts, the following Mss., containing almost the same texts or some of them, have been consulted and compared with<ref type="mss" corresp="ESaqg005">AQG-005</ref>: Orient. 686 (cp. WrBriMus 167, n<locus target="257">257</locus>), Orient.<ref type="mss" corresp="ES687688">687-688</ref>(cp. WrBriMus 167, n<locus target="257">257</locus>). The Catalague of Wright (WrBriMus) has been used as reference for some of the saints names and the commemoration dates.</note>
                     <note>- On <locus target="270va">270va-</locus>vb, after Text I-36, a long Subscriptio concludes the entire work:</note>
                     <note>[<locus target="270va">270va</locus>] ተፈጸመ፡ በዝየ፡ ገድሎሙ፡ ለቅዱሳን፡ ሰማዕት፡ እለ፡ ተሣየጡ፡ በሞት፡ ሕይወት፨ ... ወአጽሐፊሁሰ፡ ለዝንቱ፡ መጽሓፍ፡ አቡነ፡ &lt;…&gt; ረባን፡ አበ፡ መነኮሳት፡ ... [<locus target="270vb">270vb</locus>] ምስለ፡ ጸሓፊሁ፡ ሳሙኤል፡ … ወምስለ፡ አኃው፡ ዘደብረ፡&lt;…&gt; ….</note>
                     <note>The note mentions the commissioner, whose name here is erased. He must be the afore mentioned ʾabuna Ṗeṭros who is mentioned in the exhortations throughout the Ms. In the subscriptio, after the erasure there are the titles räban (“master”; s. also on <locus target="262rb">262rb</locus>) and ʾabä mänäkosat (“the head of the monks”). They are probably referred to Filǝṗṗos (s. above), the ʾabuna Ṗeṭros' "father". At the end of the note, there is the mention of the scribe Sāmuʾel, to whom some of the exhortations are dedicated, and of the "brothers of the däbr" from where most probably also the commissioner and the scribe come.</note>
                     <note/>
                     <note>- Some of the gädl (i.e. I-1, I-2, I-10, I-13, I-14, I-15, I-17, I-21, I-22, I-23, I-27, I-28 ) end with a final note with the concluding formula “ተፈጸመ፡ (or ተፈጸመ፡ ብዝየ፡) ገድሉ፡…” of the text, followed sometimes by the commemoration dates of the saints to whom the text is dedicated, or also by supplication formulas.</note>
                     <note>These final notes are alone or are followed by exhortation notes, short or extended, (ጸልዩ፡ ለዘ…) for the commissioner (sometimes also for his children, or for the children of his place), for the scribe, the reader, the translator of the gädl, and for the ones who believe and make the “tazkār” of the saints to whom the gädl is dedicated. These exhortations are after the majority of the texts (i.e. I-1, I-2 I-3 I-4 I-5, I-6 I-8, I-9, I-10 I-11, I-12, I-13, I-16, I-17, I-18, I-19, I-20, I-21, I-23, I-24, I-25, I-27, I-29, I-30, I-31, I-32, I-33, I-34, I-35).</note>
                     <note/>
                     <note>- About the scribe and the mention of his name in the above mentioned exhortation notes, s. above in “short content”. On <locus target="23rb">23rb</locus>, in the exhortation at the end of Text I-2, the name of the scribe has been erased.</note>
                     <note>- In the exhortation notes on <locus target="89rb">89rb</locus>, 91ra, 98rb, 114rb, 120ra, 127rb, respectively at the end of Texts I-12, I-13, I-11, I-14, I-17, I-18, the commissioner, ʾAbuna Ṗeṭros, is said to be “lover of the Gadla sämaʿtat” (መፍቀሬ፡ ገድሎሙ፡ ለሰማዕታት).</note>
                     <note>On <locus target="127rb">127rb</locus>, it is also written that he is the “master of the ‘temple’” (መምህረ፡ አላዳስ).</note>
                     <note>On <locus target="41vb">41vb</locus>,150va, he is mentioned as: ʾabuna Ṗeṭros za-Dabra Mämhǝr.</note>
                     <note>About the mention of the commissioner on the other folios, s. above in “short content”.</note>
                     <note/>
                     <note>Details on some texts:</note>
                     <note>- Text I-4. The miracles are not numbered.</note>
                     <note>- Text I-25. On <locus target="187va">187va</locus>, at the end of the text, as the month of the commemoration date for the martyrs ʾArǝrinosofis, Peter and ʾƎskǝryon, is written Ṗäsini (ጰሲኒ), instead of the Ethiopian name ሰኔ.</note>
                     <note>Comparing the same text in, e.g., Orient. 686, the month at the same passage is written as Ṗahin/Ṗaḥin (ጳሂን/ጳሒን). Ṗaḥin (c. Dillmann Lexicon, p. 1251) is the Ethiopian name for Paōni, the 10th month of the Coptic Calendar, which corresponds to the Ethiopian month Sane.</note>
                     <note>In the text of<ref type="mss" corresp="ESaqg005">AQG-005</ref>, Ṗäsini might appear phonetically more similar to the 9th month (in Sahidic) of the Coptic calendar, i.e. Pašons (s. CE II, 439). It also look as if it is an assimilation (scribe mistake?) of ጰ (from the Coptic month) and ሲኒ (from ሰኔ).</note>
                     <note>At the left margin of the Coptic month, probably as cue for the rubricator, is annotated the letter ግ.</note>
                     <note>- Text I-27. On <locus target="222rb">222rb</locus>, the text ends with the colophon of the work with the mention of Metropolitan ʾAbbā salāma (Metropolitan from 1350 or 1348; cp. EAE IV, 488-89) and its work of translation from Arabic into Gǝʿǝz.</note>
                     <note>At the end of the colophon, the date “1079 from the ‘Years of the Martyrs’ (እመዋዕለ፡ ሰማዕት)” is indicated. It is not clear if it refers to the year when ʾAbbā salāma translated the text. According to the “Chronologie” of Chaine, this date, 1079 E.M.D., should corresponds to 1363 A.D. (cp. ChChron, 161).</note>
                     <note>- Text I-16. On <locus target="196va">196va</locus>, at the end of text, as month of the commemoration date of the martyr ʾAtnasewos, it is given the month ʾIyolyu (ኢዮልዩ) and after it Ḥamle, mentioned as the correspondent month in Gǝʿǝz. ʾIyolyu appears phonetically very similar to “Iulius”, the Latin name for the month July.</note>
                     <note>- Text I-30. On <locus target="236ra">236ra</locus>, at the end of text, as month of the commemoration date of the martyr Maccabees and her 7 sons, it is written ʾAwgusṭos (አውግስጦስ). This name is mentioned as month in the byzantine calendar (በአውራኅ፡ ሮሜ); the same is on <locus target="273rb">273rb</locus> in Orient. 686.</note>

                     <roleName type="title">ʾAbuna</roleName> Ṗeṭros is mentioned as the commissioner in the subscriptio at the end of Text I-36 and in the exhortations at the end of the most texts. In many of them, his name is mentioned together with the name of his monastery (i.e. <roleName type="title">ʾabuna</roleName> Ṗeṭros za-Dabra &lt;…&gt;), which is however always partly erased. On <locus target="13rb">13rb</locus> (Text I-1) the last letter of the name is readable(ደብረ፡ &lt;…&gt;ን).&#xD;
On <locus target="228vb">228vb</locus>, 254ra, 262rb, it is said that he is the son (disciple) of <roleName type="title">ʾabuna</roleName> Filǝṗos, named the “righteous” (“ṣadǝq”, <locus target="254rb">254rb</locus>) and the “teacher” (“räban”, <locus target="262rb">262rb</locus>, 270va). Considering this date and the small clue on <locus target="13rb">13rb</locus>, it might be possible suppose that the monastery of <roleName type="title">ʾabuna</roleName> Ṗeṭros and where this Ms. was originated is Dabra Bizän (in Eritrea). The founder of this monastery was the monk Filǝṗos (1322/23-1406; cp. EAE II, 15-17). &#xD;
On <locus target="57vb">57vb</locus>, <roleName type="title">ʾabuna</roleName> Ṗeṭros is mentioned as the abbot (ʾabä mǝnet) of his monastery.&#xD;
According to an additional note in a Bible Ms. from Dabra Bizän, Ṗeṭros is mentioned as the 4th “mamhǝr” of the monastery, third successor of the founder Filǝṗos. His death is to be collocated between 1488/89 and   1491/92. His predecessor was Säräqä Bǝrhān (d. 1460/61 or 1457/58) (cp. Schneider, in AÉ 1978, 138-39).</persName>

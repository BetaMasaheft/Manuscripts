                           red ink, mentions ʾato Gabra Haylu (baptismal name Gabra Giyorgis) as the
                           owner of the Ms. and ʾato Kahsay Haylu (baptismal name Walda Māryām) as
                           the commissioner and the one who donated it to the church (tabot) of
                           ʾabuna Yasay Dǝrba. Besides them, the names of the Walda Māryām’s
                           relatives are mentioned: his father Walda Rufāʾel, his mother Walatta
                           Kidān. At the end it is mentioned the date in which the Ms. was written:
                           1949 A.M., on the 18th of Maggābit. In the date, after the abbreviation
                           (ዓ፡) for ዓመት፡, the word ምሕረት፡, designating the Ethiopian year, is
                           missing. On <locus target="#36rb">36rb</locus>

                              pencil and probably by a different hand, at the right side of the

                           scribe himself: the rubrications of the name of the protagonist and parts
                           of the text are carried out by the scribe himself, the rubrications of
                           the names of the donor or the commissioner of the Ms. seem to be written
                           by a secondary hand but with the same ink.&#xD; - A few times the letters
                           ሠ and ሰ are exchanged (s., e.g, the name of Yasay on <locus target="#7vb">7vb</locus> l.5).&#xD; - On <locus target="#35vb">35vb</locus>, the
                           word ሃሌሉያ፡ (“halleluiah”), followed by the words እምቅ፡ ዓ፡ የነብር፡ አምላክ፡ (?),
                           is written in red ink ‒ by the same hand which filled the rubricated
                           spaces in the supplication formulas throughout the Ms. ‒ Within the frame
                           of the text divider (two chains of red and black dots with nine dots
                           asterisks in the middle).&#xD; - On <locus target="#35vb">35vb</locus>,
                           at the bottom of the column, the names of some individuals are written by
                           the same hand and ink as for the words above mentioned (not clear whether
                           as continuation of them), within the frame of the text divider (two
                           chains of red and black dots) which delimits Text II from the following
                           additio (Additio 1, on the next fol.). &#xD; These individuals are: Gabra

                           together or individually, both in the supplication formulas throughout
                           the Ms. (written by the same hand as on <locus target="#35vb">35vb</locus>) and in Additio 1. However, they are mentioned in roles
                           which do not coincide:&#xD; in supplication formula on <locus target="#7ra">7ra</locus> (<locus from="13" to="14">13-14</locus>),
                           Gabra Giyorgis is mentioned as the commissioner; in Additio 1 he is
                           mentioned as the owner of the Ms. while Walda Māryām occurs as the donor
                           and the commissioner (cp. Additio 1). Again in Additio 1, the names of
                           the individuals mentioned as the Walda Māryām’s relatives are the same
                           names mentioned as the Gabra Giyorgis’ relatives on <locus target="#35vb">35vb</locus>, i.e., Walda Rufāʾel and Walatta Kidān.&#xD; - The names
                           of Gabra Giyorgis or of his relatives (s. above) are written
                           interlineally: e.g., <locus target="#3ra">3ra</locus>, 11rb.&#xD; -
                           Omitted letters or words are written interlineally: e.g., <locus target="#17ra">17ra</locus>, 22rb, 33va, 34va.&#xD; - Erasures marked

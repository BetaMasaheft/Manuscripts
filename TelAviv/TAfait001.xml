                        <summary>Fol. 1a. The Book of Job. Division into chapters is lacking -- 9a.
                            The Book of Proverbs. Divided, like the text of the Septuagint, into
                            Misleiat (Proverbs) comprising chapters 1-24 and 30, 1-31, 9, and
                            Tagsatsa Salomon (The reprimand of Solomon) comprising chapters 25-29
                            and 31,10-31. The book is divided into small sections (kifl) which do
                            not correspond to the traditional division into chapters. There are
                            altogether 43 such divisions in the Misleiat and 4 in the Tagsatza. --
                            16a. The Book of Ecclesiastes. Divided into 20 small divisions (kifls)
                            -- 18b. The Wisdom of Solomon. Divided into 28 kifls. In this and the
                            following book, the writing is still nice, but the lettersare slender
                            and mean in comparison with the writing in the previous books -- 24a.
                            The Song of songs. Divided into 5 songs, namely 1, 1-2,7; 2,8-3,5;
                            3,6-5,8; 5,9-6,8; 6,9 ad finem. The songs 2-5 are headed by the
                            following captions:2,8 - Second song relating the descent of the unique
                            and his incarnation by means of the Virgin ; 3,6 - Third song telling
                            the ascension of Him who became man; to the God with whom he had been
                            One .5,9 - Fourth song telling the praise of the Pride of the
                            Bridegroom. 6.9 - Fifth song being a Monologue of the Holy Christian
                            Church. -- 26. The Epistle to the Romans. This Epistle and all the
                            following are preceded each by an introduction styled "mekeniat" =
                            occasion, cause (full title: "the occasion of Paul's the Apostle's
                            writing to..."). The introductions are of considerable interest. Only
                            part of them can be traced in the N.T. manuscripts listed in the
                            catalogues of other public and private libraries hitherto published. But
                            Dillmann lists in his Catalogue of the Ethiopic Manuscripts of the
                            British Museum (London 1841), under No .12 a "Mashafa Mekeniat"
                            containing the introductions to all the Epistles of Paul without the
                            texts of the Epistles. In the title the Epistle to the Romans is
                            designated as the first (!). -- 32a. The first Epistle to the
                            Corinthians. In fol. 38a a new handwriting begins. The letters are
                            small, rather broad and rounded -- 38b. The second Epistle to the
                            Corinthians.. Besides the division into kifls, there is on the margin a
                            division into smaller sections, altogether 50 of them, for instance:
                            l,l-7; 8-14; 15-19 etc. -- 43b. The Epistle to the Galatians -- 45b. The
                            Epistle to the Ephesians. Divided into 30 small sections, besides the
                            division into kifls -- 48a. The Epistle to the Philippians -- 49b. The
                            Epistle to the Colossians. In the title the name Colossians is written
                            "qosaye", which is only a mistake. In the text, the name is written
                            correctly "qolasaye" -- 51b. The first Epistle to the Thessalonians --
                            52b.The second Epistle to the Thessalonians -- 53b. The first Epistle to
                            Timothy -- 55a. The second Epistle to Timothy -- 56a. The Epistle to
                            Titus -- 57a. The Epistle to Philemon -- 57b. The Epistle to the Hebrews
                            -- 62b. The Revelation of St. John (Only until Chap. 19.) -- 69a. The
                            Acts of the Apostles (Only until Chap. 22.17 -- 81a. The Book of Hosea
                            -- The Book of Amos -- 85b. The Book of Micah -- 87b. The Book of Joel
                            -- 88a. The Book of Obadiah -- 88b. The Book of Jonah -- 89a. The Book
                            of Nahum -- 90a. The Book of Habakuk -- 90b. The Book of Zephaniah --
                            91b. The Book of Haggai -- 92a. The Book of Zechariah -- 95a. The Book
                            of Malachi -- The folios 98b and 99a are covered by a hymn to the honor
                            of St. Peter and St. Paul, written according to the well known pattern
                            of the Ethiopic Salams,in which every member of the body of the Saint is
                            addressed and praised in turn.</summary>

                            <note>The manuscript is apparently part of a full sized Bible which comprised both the Old and the New Testaments. Test collations of the books of the 0.T. with the Asmara Bible Edition, of the Wisdom of Solomon with the text in Dillmann's Libri Apocryphi, 1894, and of the books of the N.T. with Platt's edition (Novum Testamentum, 1899), proved that there are numerous variants, among which quite interesting readings. The corrections are also interesting to study, although they are not always commendable. </note>

The hand which wrote the first section distinguishes itself by its fine calligraphy. Beginnings of books and chapters and important words or passages are written with red ink. In the second section the writing is poor and faulty. Whole lines had to be erased and written anew by a corrector. In the third section no more red ink has been employed.Sometimes place has been left for the insertion of lines in red ink, but these places have been filled afterwards with the missing words in black ink.</handNote></handDesc>
